            <p>I love music! I love listening to many different types of music. I am one of those people that says that they like every genre of music, but I definitely have my favorites. Here have a linked a few of my favorite genres and will dive into some of my favorites of each genre.

           I know my music taste isn't anything new or out of this world but I still like to share the songs I like and I am interested in. I am not saying that I have the best music taste either, though of course people usually think their music taste is elite.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                My name is Jessica McDonald and I am currently a sophomore at UNCC. I am majoring in Computer Science and Math. I have loved music my whole life and my parents have always made sure that music was incorporated in my life somehow since a very young age.
                I grew up listening to all of my dad's old CDs in the car on road trips and on an old boombox he had. I remember being little and dancing around our house to Dancing Queen by ABBA and Fat Bottomed Girls by Queen. This was probably my first exposure to the music I love today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Starting in 4th grade I joined band and played all the way through highschool. I love playing music almost as much as I love listening to music. Starting when I got access to the internet (probably sometime in middle school) I started developing my own personal tastes for music
                which have slowly developed over the years and have ultimately lead me to where I am today. I started making playlists on Spotify and many other platforms in late middle school and I have been doing it ever since. Making a new playlist, discovering new music, and listening to music are some of 
                my favorite things in the whole world. Music has become my life as listening to music as become more accessable. I can now listen to music wherever and whenever I want as long as a have a set of headphones on me. This has led me to have some pretty crazy listening times on my Spotify wrapped.
                <br>
                <br>
                Listening, learning, and creating music has changed my life and that's why listening to music is my favorite hobby!

                        I have just recently started getting into buying records and I only have one basic record player currently. Records can be expensive and hard to find so it's not my ideal way to listen to music.
                        I do like collecting records though because they are a fun thing to have. I like the sound the record player gives and the vibe that it fits. It is very homey.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The only records I own at the moment are 3 Jim Croce records, including Greating Hits and I Got a Name. I also recently purchased and Eagles greatest hits record. Jim Croce is probably my favorite
                        artist crossing multiple genres so I was thrilled when I found multiple of his albums as records, and they weren't expensive!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My goal one day is to own Some Girls by The Rolling Stones (my favorite album of all time) and Tattoo You by The Rolling Stones as records. These are two of my favorite albums and I love the cover and the music of course.

                        I have so many CDs it would probably take me ours on end to count exactly how many I have. I have loved CDs for a long time because growing up I has a CD clock radio that would play as my alarm every morning before school. I especially loved it because it was pink.
                        Most of my CDs I have been given by family members, mostly my dad. He has given me so many CDs that my car counsel is now overflowing into the holders on the doors.

                    <li>
                        I have too many CDs to name every single one but some of my favorites are of coure, the Jim Croce CD I burned, Queen's greatest hits, FleetWood Mac Greatest Hits, and All Things Must Pass by George Harrison.

                        Spotify Premium has single handedly changed my life for the better forever. I do not know what I would do without it. I can download all my playlists and listen to them all day everyday for how every long I want and wherever I want.
                        Spotify is the number one used app on my phone most days. Sometimes I average 8-12 hours a day using Spotify. Spotify is where I make all my playlists to fit every occasion and so I can listen to all the songs I love in one place. So I can pick a playlist that fits the vibe of whatever mood I am in.

                        Currently, my longest Spotify playlist has 765 songs on it! My shortest is at about 16 songs. I also like how with Spotify you can listen to the same song over and over again until you can't bare it anymore. I do this a lot when I find a song I really like. Spotify lets you make playlists with your friends which is another feature I like because
                        I love sharing music with my family and friends!

        <h2>When do I listen to music?</h2>
        <div class="container">
        
            <p>I listen to music throughout all times of the day. I mainly started listening to music when I did homework. My favorite thing to listen to when I do homework is songs from the Studio Ghibli movies or Joe Hisashi who is the composer for many of 
                the songs from those movie. I don't have him featured on this sight but he has had a big impact on the classical music I have begun listening to. I like to listen to other classicla music soundtracks while I do work like music from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and the Nutcracker. 
                Even when it isn't Christmas, I like listening to the instrumental album A Charlie Brown Christmas by Vince Guaradli Trio. This was my favorite study music for like a 3 month period recently!
            <br>
            <br>
                Other than that I usually just listen to whatever music I am in the mood for, whenever can and whenever I want to! Luckily with technology advancements I am able to listen to music pretty much anywhere thanks to the inventions of wireless headphones, downloading music to listen offline, and bluetooth car connect so I can play music through my car.
                I am lucky to be living in a time with all these advancements because I don't know what I would do without them!

                <p>Folk music is a genre that I have really been into lately, especially because it features one of my favorite artists Jim Croce. The folk music I mainly listen to is from the 60s and 70s. Though this the time from of most of the music I like I would say my folk music is more tunneled into an 10 year window of 1965-1975, making it more specific of a style of music.</p>

                    <p>Jim Croce became one of my favorite artists very quickly. I think I like almost every single one of his songs. He has a wide variety of different vibes to his songs (sad, happy, etc.) which is why I started liking him so much. I am also a big fan of the guitar that's featured in almost every single one of his songs. 
                        It's hard for me to pick a favorite but I will list some of them out below.</p>

                <p>Folk rock is probably one of my favorite genre's of all time. Most of my favorite bands and artists fall under this category, so maybe that has something to do with it. I think I like this genre a lot because I like how most of the songs are upbeat but still incorporate some of the softer guitar of songs that
                    would be categrized as just folk music. One thing I look for a lot in songs is lyrics but I also like when the background music blends well and I find that in this genre there's usually a story that flows well with the music.

                <div class="some_girls">
                    <p>The Rolling Stones is by far my favorite rock group of all time. I love so many of their songs and luckily I have plenty to choose from since they've made a lot of musice. I LOVE the <strong>'Some Girls'</strong> album that came out
                    in 1978. I don't have a single skip on that album.</p>
                    <p>My Favorites From "Some Girls" Are:</p>

                <div class="tattoo_you">
                    <p>Another album that I love by The Rolling Stones it <strong>'Tattoo You'</strong>. This album is definitely second to <strong>'Some Girls'</strong> but I still love all the songs on it.
                    This album is a different vibe from the other one probably because it did come out a little later, in 1981.</p>

                <p>I've recently gotten into jazz music because I started listening to it a lot when I do homework or when I am cooking. Hiroshi Suzuki (鈴木弘) is one of my favorite Jazz artists and he is how I found out about more jazz artists. The specific group of artists or small section of jazz artists
                    I listen to are all Japanese artists from the 1970s. I find that I like their style of jazz music the best. Suzuki, specifically, is a trombonist from Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. I am also interested in artists such as Ryo Fukui, Masabumi Kikuchi, Jiro Inagaki. There are many more artists in the 1970s Japanese Jazz category that I am interested in listening to and learning about!

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because why not!!! Just kidding. Music gives me an outlet for my emotions and however I am feeling, sad, happy, etc. It's also a great way for me to connect with my friends so we can talk about music and what songs we like and don't like. Why one person likes one song over another.
                    It's fun! Listening to music is fun! You can sing and dance to it and what's not to love about that. Music makes me happy and makes me feel fulfilled.

                Used AI to help me with the javascript for the nav bar. I wanted to make it all one function and it helped me do that and implement it into my html.
            </li>
            <li>
                I had never used audio before so I looked up how to implement that - w3 schools.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, my function (for making the record player on each page) was only working for one of my pages and not all of them so I asked AI to help me and I had to change my function to take class and not id for each of the audios.
            </li>
            <li>
                Looked up how to put a border on my text letters for styling e.i. "-webkit-text-stroke" - Stack Overflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                For my .genre_txt in css I had to ask AI how to get the content to wrap with out everything getting smushed into eachother because I couldn't get them to stop overlapping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Had to look up syntax for making a background image ( i forgot :/ ) - w3 schools.
            </li>
            <li>
                For my playlist, I used AI to help me make the function for it because I think I made one carousel once on freeCodeCamp but I couldn't I was messing up the javascript a lot even though I could remember most of the html.
