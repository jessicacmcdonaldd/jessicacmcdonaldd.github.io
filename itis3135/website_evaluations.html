    <h3>Good Website</h3>
    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://admr.com/"><u>ADMR</u></a></h3>
        <p>
            This is the website for American Direct Marketing Resources. It allows customers to interact and see what the company stands for and find their contact information so customers can contact 
            them is they want anymore information. Their website also has a nice message from the CEO on the homepage and a quick scroll to see what kind of marketable mailing they can help you with and a brief description of it. Allows customers to easily see how American Direct may be able to help them.

        <ul>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Contrast- The contract on this website is done really well. It has a light blue and white background that scroll by images as the background sometimes which
                makes it tasteful. The text is black but not thick so it is easy to read. There are also elements of blue and red throughout the main part of the website and the header which gives it more color.
                There are also certain designs on parts of the background which contrast with the white and make the page look less boring but also not too busy.
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Repetition- This website has nice repetition in the navigation bar and the colors on the website. The website starts with a dark navy at the top and repeats at the bottom of the page. Then the very light blue and
                white colors for the background repeat from one to another as you scroll down the page. There is also repetition in the footer with the contact information.
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Alignment- The alignment on this website is done really well. The navigation bar and the header are nicely aligned together and then the information in the footer is all nicely aligned with one another. The text, images, and information in the 
                body are nicely aligned going from being aligned on the left to being aligned on the right which makes it less jumpled up and easier to read. The text within each border is aligned well so its not too crushed and busy.
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Proximity- The proximity is really good here. Easy to find navigation bar and information within it isn't too close. Footer also has good proximity, all the links at the bottom are spaced well so it's easy to find what you are looking for.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bad Website</h3>
        <h3><a href="https://best-electronics-ca.com/"><u>Atari Best Electronics</u></a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Contrast- The contrast is probably the only thing on this website I would say is not too horrible. The background of this website is white with black and other dark text colors so you will be able to read all the words on the website if you can stand the headache. All the text is bolded so there is definitely a strong contrast against the white background.
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Repetition- There is so much text repition it's insane. This website is one long page of just text continuing down the page over and over again. The text has few small breaks in between but not enough to make a difference. The website also has the same repeating bolded colored text
                black, blue, green, red and orange. This colors seem to just be repeated at random throughout the long monstrous text filled page. Occasionally, you will see another color that is not repeated as often as these though.
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle">
                Alignment- This website has zero alignment in my opinion. All the text is aligned left with no idention and it fills the page all the way from the left side to the right side. It makes it very hard to read even though all of the text is super strong and contrasted. There is no alignment around images or text with borders. The text 
                wraps around the images poorly and it makes it confusing to read. The text with borders around it is very hard to find but when you do find it in there it doesn't do much for the eyes and the spacing is off. 
            </li>
            <li style=" list-style-type: circle"> 
                Proximity- This website doesn't know what proximity is. All the text is so close together it makes it hard to read and you don't know when you are going from one section to another. It's super un-user friendly because there is not navigation so you just have to scroll through the jumples of text until you may or may not 
                be able to find what you are looking for. Hopefully the users of the website know what CTRL + F is. The photos don't have a good proximity to the text either and they feel kind of thrown in and sometimes it is hard to tell which text describes which image because of how everything is all close together.
